## Feedback
Fancy Comments is just in version 1.0.0 (beta) as of now and therefore you may find certain snippets/features 
missing. It would be great if you could create a [new issue on GitHub here](https://github.com/ClydeDz/fancy-comments/issues) and let me know what you're after and I can include 
that in the product backlog for next releases. Please search the issues first before creating a new one.
